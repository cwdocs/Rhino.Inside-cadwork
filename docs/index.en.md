## Grasshopper

Grasshopper :cricket: is a graphical algorithm editor that integrates with Rhino3D modeling tools. You use Grasshopper to design algorithms that then automate tasks in Rhino3D.
Grasshopper's visual "plug-and-play" style gives designers the ability to combine creative problem solving with novel control systems through the use of a fluid graphical interface.

A component needs data to perform its actions, and it usually produces a result. For this reason, most components have a set of nested parameters called inputs and outputs, respectively. The input parameters are on the left side, and the output parameters are on the right side.

There are a few Grasshopper components that have inputs but no outputs, or vice versa. If a component has no inputs or outputs, it has a jagged edge.

## Components

![Backup Text](img/comps.png "Components")

The components are divided into four sections. <br>
The **Attributes** section contains components for handling attributes.<br>
In the **Select** section you will find all components for selecting cadwork elements. <br>
In the **Create Elements** section you can find the components for creating cadwork elements. <br>
The last section **Architecture** contains components for creating architectural elements. 

### Context menu

Some components offer functionalities via the context menu. The context menu is called up by right-clicking on the icon. <br>

Via the context menu you can

* Select Cadwork Elements
* Preview 
* Bake Elements <br>

control.
